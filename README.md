## ðŸ”¥ Dangerzone Writing ðŸ”¥ for Obsidian

Hey all, Iâ€™ve been a paying customer of [FlowState](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/flowstate/id1060276201) since 2016 and wanted something similar for Obsidian.

Itâ€™s really fun. And stressful. But mostly fun.

Basically, you start a timer for X minutes and during those X minutes you must write continuously. If you pause longer than 5 seconds, everything youâ€™ve written is deleted.

## When to use the Dangerzone

- Use it to "warm" up your writing muscle
- Use it to write that first draft however dirty and ragged
- Use it to keep you focused on one task

## How to use the Dangerzone

How to use this plugin

1. Open a note in Obsidian
2. Click the "Stopwatch" icon in the left bar to start the timer
3. From now on, the count-down from 100 to 0 starts
4. Start writing!
5. DO NOT STOP WRITING
6. If you DO stop writing for more than 5 seconds, everything you've written in this note so far is DELETED.

Again. If you stop for more than 5 seconds, your writing in this note is deleted. 

## Let me know how it goes!
