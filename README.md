Hey all, I’ve been a paying customer of [FlowState](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/flowstate/id1060276201) since 2016 and wanted something similar for Obsidian.

It’s really fun. And stressful. But mostly fun.

**It's simple:** 

1. You start a timer for X minutes. 
2. THEN, during those X minutes you MUST write continuously. 
3. The catch: If you PAUSE for longer than 5 seconds, everything you’ve written is DELETED.

Here's an example session:

## When to use Dangerzone Writing

- Use it to "warm" up your writing muscle
- Use it to write that first draft however dirty and ragged
- Use it to keep you laser-focused on writing

## How to use the Dangerzone Writing plugin 

1. Open a note in Obsidian^
2. Click the "Stopwatch" icon in the left bar to start the timer
3. From now on, the count-down from 60 seconds to 0 starts
4. Start writing!
5. DO. NOT. STOP. WRITING for 60 seconds.
6. If you DO stop writing for more than 5 seconds, everything you've written in this note so far is DELETED.

Again, let me be clear: If you stop for more than 5 seconds, your writing in this note will be deleted. 

^ I usually create an empty one, but that's not necessary
## How to start as a beginner

If you've never used this type of writing before, I highly recommend starting with the defaults and an empty note to get a feeling for it. 

Gradually increase session time as you get more comfortable with this type of challenge. 

## How to personalize your sessions and fuse time

To optimize your flow experience, you can configure your:

- Countdown duration (Default 60s)
- Seconds-to-deletion fuse (Default 5s)

## Successful sessions tracking

You get a +1 🎉 for every Dangerzone Writing session you complete successfully. 
"Successfully" means that once the timer is up, there is at least _some_ text there (indicating you didn't just give up and let the countdown finish).

This plugin is provided as-is with no warranty that it'll work exactly as you expect. It's made to DELETE text in a note after X seconds of inactivity when you're start a session. Please do not hold me responsible if it does, in fact, DELETE your text. That's what it does.
